**WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Powered** is a complete foundation for building your WordPress plugins following PSR-4
standard.

The project history is part of the [Wiki](https://wpbp.github.io/wiki.html) that also includes the workflow and how it
is organized.

Every experienced WordPress developer uses always the same libraries (or snippets) but at the same time follows best
practices.

Choose a library or a snippet and the boilerplate (with the help of
the [Code Generator](https://wpbp.github.io/#generator))
will generate everything without the need of manual copy & paste way or searching on the Internet!

## Features

* [Code Generator](https://github.com/WPBP/generator) to start development
* Sass support and WebPack (not mandatory because the generator can remove them)
* PSR-4 support by Composer
  but [extended](https://github.com/WPBP/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Powered/blob/master/plugin-name/engine/class-initialize.php)
  to load classes based on request type and folder structure
* Tools integrated like [GrumpPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp) (automatically on commit)
  and [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/)
* [GitHub Action](https://github.com/WPBP/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Powered/blob/master/.github/workflows/integrate.yml)
  and [GitLab CI](https://gist.github.com/Mte90/abbb816e9755f189ad52272e71b7c959) available
* Many libraries already available (with starter code)

You should be able to run the commands and edit the files mentioned below to get started.
Read all these links and edit the code however you like using the libraries, snippets, and tools listed below.
